## Dataset
The email dataset is downloaded from https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/

**Further details can be found in the program file as it has been documented.**

## Final Model
The final model has been trained on the easy email set. 

## Future Work
1. To train the model on the hard email dataset.
2. To deploy a model.pkl file and making a simple website for others to check whether an email is spam or not.
